                <p>An improvement over the original 600d, the LS 600d Pro Light Storm Daylight LED Light from Aputure offers expansive power, control options, and output comparable to a 1200W HMI, augmented by its 55° Hyper Reflector. The precision fixture has a solid

                                            5600K color temperature with a high CRI/TLCI rating of 96 that is great for location shooting outdoors, or in areas dominated by other daylight-balanced fixtures such as HMIs. Besides power, control is a driving force in the design of the 600d Pro. The light also has a myriad of wireless control methods, such as the included 2.4 GHz remote, the Sidus Link mobile app, and the built-in wireless DMX control. It has four dimming curves: Linear, Exponential, Log, and S-Curve, to ensure accuracy regardless of your chosen brightness level. While you can make adjustments locally on the fixture, you can also make them wirelessly at a distance up to 328' via these methods - a real attribute for lights mounted overhead or in hard to reach places.
                                            The LS 600d Pro Light Storm Daylight LED is available in V-Mount or Gold Mount.
